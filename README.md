# vimrc

My personal vim configuration being used on my laptop as well as on servers I
have to deal with. Optimized for PYTHON, PHP and JS.

## Editor configuration

The config uses .editorconfig

## Hotkeys

The config uses a lot of various key bindings. For full list see the `.vimrc` file directly=)
Note: `<leader>` is set to the comma (`,`) key.

 - `<leader>/` - unhighlight the last search occurrences

## Kotlin syntax checkers

```
$ cp -r syntax_checkers/kotlin ~/.vim/syntax_checkers/
```

## Devel Info

Based on Ikar (http://github.com/porn) and Josef (http://github.com/josef-spak) configuration.
