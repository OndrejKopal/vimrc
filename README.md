# vimrc

My personal vim configuration being used on my laptop as well as on servers I
have to deal with. Optimized for PHP and JS. Based on Ikar and Josef configuration.

## TODO
 - set css and js syntax
 - generation js function tags for TagBar

## Hotkeys

The config uses a lot of various key bindings. For full list see the `.vimrc` file directly=)
Note: `<leader>` is set to the comma (`,`) key.

 - `<leader>/` - unhighlight the last search occurrences
