# vimrc

My personal vim configuration being used on my laptop as well as on servers I
have to deal with. Optimized for PHP and JS. Based on Ikar and Josef configuration.

## Installation
If you can use tern.js and jsctags for generation javascript tags, You must
install tern and jsctags module for node.js. Reade more here:

## TODO
 - set css and js syntax for TagBar

## Hotkeys

The config uses a lot of various key bindings. For full list see the `.vimrc` file directly=)
Note: `<leader>` is set to the comma (`,`) key.

 - `<leader>/` - unhighlight the last search occurrences
